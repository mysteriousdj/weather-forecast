# Weather-Forecast

BootCamp Challenge - 06 Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## Description

To create a 5 Day weather forecast in searched cities. [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/) was used to create the forecast. 


## Process 

To understand the objective of the challenge, I first read through the README.md. I researched APIs and applied what I learned from Project One to grasp an understanding on what needed to be done. 

Throughout the index.html, styles.css and script.js, I included comments to each section for easier configeration in the future.
